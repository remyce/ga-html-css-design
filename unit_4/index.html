	                  	<img src="images/vegancafe3.jpeg" alt="Picture of a Cafe" title="Vegan Cafe">
	                  	<p>The cafe is the reincarnation of the long-standing but now defunct Pogo Cafe, with new decor and similar food. You order from a daily-changing chalkboard menu and sit at communal tables.</p>
	                  	<p>Herbivores will enjoy the fry-ups at weekends and pies, salads and soups during the week. The 25 teas include a panoply of rooibos and blacks, and the cappuccino with Bonsoy mylk is a winner. Kale is a regular.</p>
	                  	<p>Its the kind of vegan food that's heavy on animal substitutes: soy and similar takes on cheese, sausage and egg. The Monte Cristo sandwich is comforting without leaving you laden - and worth amplifying with Sriracha or tomato ketchup. The fry-up with beans, potatos, pancake, tofu scramble, mushroom and sausage (get the Vegusto for an extra pound) is more gentle than hearty, leaving room for a gingery parkin that's just sweet enough</p>
